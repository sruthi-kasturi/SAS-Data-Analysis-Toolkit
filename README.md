## Introduction
This repository contains SAS scripts that demonstrate the capabilities of SAS in handling different data-related tasks. The scripts are categorized into data import/export, statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

## File Descriptions

### 1. Data Import and Export
- **1.1.sas**
  - Imports data from CSV, XLS, XLSX, and TXT files.
  - Exports data to CSV, XLS, and XLSX files.
  - Demonstrates handling of files with and without headers.

- **1.2.sas**
  - Imports a CSV file and performs univariate analysis.
  - Generates histograms and executes correlation analysis between variables.

- **1.3.sas**
  - Imports multiple CSV files, merges datasets, filters data, and creates new variables.
  - Exports filtered data to new CSV files.

### 2. Statistical Analysis
- **2.1.sas**
  - Imports data and performs descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.

- **2.2.sas**
  - Conducts ANOVA, chi-square tests, and correlation analysis on imported data.

- **2.3.sas**
  - Focuses on data visualization with histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

### 3. Machine Learning
- **3.1.sas**
  - Implements machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and clustering algorithms.

- **3.2.sas**
  - Performs data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features for machine learning models.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2. Open the SAS files in your SAS environment.
3. Modify the file paths and parameters as needed.
4. Run the scripts to perform the desired data operations and analyses.
